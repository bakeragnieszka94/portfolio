## üß™ Methodology

The project uses a combination of descriptive and diagnostic techniques:

| Technique         | Tool/Method Used                     | Purpose                                              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Descriptive       | Power BI                             | Visualize crime patterns and monthly trends          |
| Statistical Test  | Chi-Square Test in R                 | Check dependence of crime type on location           |
| Geospatial        | Getis-Ord Gi\* Statistic (R)         | Detect crime hotspots and cold spots using GPS data  |

Data sources:
- üìÇ [Police Data API](https://data.police.uk/data/)
- üìÇ [LSOA Northeast Dataset (UK Gov)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60423ba6e90e077dd43107f4/LSOA_-_A_-_North_East_1819.ods)

## üìå Key Insights

- **Newcastle** is a consistent hotspot, with high frequency and high % of unsolved cases.
- **Shoplifting** is unusually high in South Tyneside; **vehicle crime** spikes in Sunderland.
- **Getis-Ord Gi\*** results revealed crime concentration hotspots not visible through basic charts.
- Seasonal peaks were observed in **November**, suggesting possible links with environmental or social factors.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Limitations & Considerations

- Data covers **only 1 year**, limiting long-term pattern recognition.
- Some entries contain **missing or unknown values**, which may bias results.
- Results are **specific to Northumbria** and may not generalize to other regions.
