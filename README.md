I'm a data analyst entering the analytics world with a unique perspective.
My background in Sport Science gave me a strong foundation in human behavior and evidence-based practice, while my Master’s in Business Analytics has developed my skills in data, research, and evaluation.
I’m passionate about using these to uncover insights, improve decision-making, and explore complex problems with data.
